## Public website

## Download local copy

1. Open the site → **Get CalmClick** → **Download free local copy**  
   or grab [`downloads/calmclick-offline.zip`](downloads/calmclick-offline.zip)
2. Unzip → double‑click `index.html`

Why local is nudged: works offline, no dependency on site uptime, folder you control.

## Browser extension

### After Chrome Web Store approval

1. Put the store URL in `config.js` → `chromeStoreUrl`
2. Rebuild zips: `powershell -File scripts/pack.ps1`
3. Redeploy / push so the site button goes “Add to Chrome”

### Install now (developer / sideload)

1. Download [`downloads/calmclick-extension.zip`](downloads/calmclick-extension.zip) or use the `extension/` folder
2. Chrome/Edge → `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → **Load unpacked**
3. Select the `extension` folder (manifest.json at the top level of that folder)
